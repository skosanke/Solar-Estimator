This code is used to estimate the price and savings associated with going solar. 
These are estimates that are relative to your estimated electric bill, and are not garaunteed savings amounts.
The program is set to compare the price of electricity buying, buying solar panels, leasing solar panels, and paying PPA monthly.
Useful for homeowners that are interested in switching over to solar, but want to visualize the savings over time.
